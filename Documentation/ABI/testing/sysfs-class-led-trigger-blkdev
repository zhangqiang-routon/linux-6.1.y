		check.

What:		/sys/class/leds/<led>/blink_on_read
Date:		January 2023
Contact:	Ian Pilcher <arequipeno@gmail.com>
Description:
		Boolean that determines whether the LED will blink in response
		to read activity on any of its linked block devices.

What:		/sys/class/leds/<led>/blink_on_write
Date:		January 2023
Contact:	Ian Pilcher <arequipeno@gmail.com>
Description:
		Boolean that determines whether the LED will blink in response
		to write activity on any of its linked block devices.

What:		/sys/class/leds/<led>/blink_on_discard
Date:		January 2023
Contact:	Ian Pilcher <arequipeno@gmail.com>
Description:
		Boolean that determines whether the LED will blink in response
		to discard activity on any of its linked block devices.

What:		/sys/class/leds/<led>/blink_on_flush
Date:		January 2023
Contact:	Ian Pilcher <arequipeno@gamil.com>
Description:
		Boolean that determines whether the LED will blink in response
		to cache flush activity on any of its linked block devices.

What:		/sys/class/leds/<led>/link_dev_by_path
Date:		January 2023
Contact:	Ian Pilcher <arequipeno@gmail.com>
Description:
		Associate a block device with this LED by writing the path to
		the device special file (e.g. /dev/sda) to this attribute.
		Symbolic links are followed.

What:		/sys/class/leds/<led>/unlink_dev_by_path
Date:		January 2023
Contact:	Ian Pilcher <arequipeno@gmail.com>
Description:
		Remove the association between this LED and a block device by
		writing the path to the device special file (e.g. /dev/sda) to
		this attribute.  Symbolic links are followed.

What:		/sys/class/leds/<led>/unlink_dev_by_name
Date:		January 2023
Contact:	Ian Pilcher <arequipeno@gmail.com>
Description:
		Remove the association between this LED and a block device by
		writing the kernel name of the device (e.g. sda) to this
		attribute.

What:		/sys/class/leds/<led>/linked_devices

Contact:	Ian Pilcher <arequipeno@gmail.com>
Description:
		Directory containing links to all block devices that are
		associated with this LED.  (Note that the names of the
		symbolic links in this directory are *kernel* names, which
		may not match the device special file paths written to
		link_device and unlink_device.)
